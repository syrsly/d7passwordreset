Drupal 7 password reset script
===============

Small PHP script you can run on your server to reset the password of the first (admin) user.

Instructions
===
Simply copy reset.php to your site's root directory and run the script.  It will set the password to "whatever" without quotes.  Then, log into your site using the username and new password (whatever) of user #1.  Optionally, you can modify this script to change any other user or change other user data, like usernames or e-mail addresses.

Requirements
===
The only requirement is Drupal 7.  If you can run Drupal 7 on your server, you can run this script.
